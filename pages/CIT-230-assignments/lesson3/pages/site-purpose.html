          <span class="oomph">Site Purpose: </span> WEATHER PREPARATION, the site's primary service is to provide helpful tips on how to dress for current weather conditions.
        </p>
        <h3>Site Name Selection</h3>
        <p>The words run gear sound very similar to rain gear. The noun rain gear is so common and familiar the thought of running gear being called run gear feels natural the first time we hear it used.

        </p>
        <h2>Run Gear Weather Prep</h2>
        <p>You're Going Out No Matter What, might as well be ready</p>
        <p>Slogan: Come What May, We're Here to Play</p>
        <h3>Domain Name Research</h3>
        <p>The domain name rungearcheck.com is now available through any DNS provider. It is not recommended to purchase domain names through GoDaddy, HostGator, or BlueHost. Pretty much any Domain Name Provider who heavily advertises to the public will include unnecessary service bundles, and hidden fees. Also, this is a custom built website so we do not need services that are centered on WordPress sites. The Hover DNS is recommended to purchase the domain name. It has been good overall.</p>
        <h3>Logo Design Considerations</h3>
        <p>the logo placeholder will be the initials of the company name. "R" + "G" has a quality to it that sounds like a man's name. Extending the abbreviation to include the full site name of Run Gear Weather Prep, "RGWP", looks and sounds strong as well. Both can work and using both will not dilute the brand recognition.</p>
        <p>The full abbreviation as a logo also lends itself to a stronger association of building a community around those who must prepare for harsh weather climates. The monetary objective of this site is to sponsor high quality weather gear and center articles and communities who are highly likely to purchase clothing and gear through our site's recommendations.</p>
