          Fonts are like hairstyles from punk to prim

        <p>
          The right font pairing delivers a brand message all on its own
        </p>
        <h3>Font Pair Selection</h3>
        <h3>Font Application</h3>
        <p>Within all content creation, the feeling of authority, sleek, modern, easy to read, and to the point messages must be conveyed through the heirarchy of font type, font size, and consistent body design.</p>
        <p>According to authors from the popular Canva design tool, "Level One: Generally, your level-one typography will be the most important content or information; this should be the most immediately visible typographic element in your design.
          Level Two: Level-two elements usually help organize your design into sections or group related information together. They shouldn’t stand out as much as your level-one type, but should clearly direct viewers to the different parts of the design and help them navigate it easily.
          Level Three: For a text-heavy layout, the level-three typography is generally the meat of the design. This is where the copywriting lives, where you get into the message of your design. It could be long or short—a whole article, a short note, a brief description—but the primary concern for this level is that it’s easy to read since the font size will likely be somewhat small.
          As an example, the design of this product page is simple, but still has at least three levels of typographic hierarchy. You could say that the product name (Major Black headphones) is level one; the price is level two, and the product description is level three. Notice how the description paragraph is set in an easy-to-read serif with a generous amount of spacing between lines (also known as “leading”)."(https://www.canva.com/learn/typeface-fonts/)</p>
