        <!-- Instead of having all the screenshots of games referenced in <img> element src attributes, which will force the browser to download them automatically, we can do it selectively via JavaScript. The js13kPWA app uses a placeholder image instead, which is small and lightweight, while the final paths to target images are stored in data-src attributes:

<img src='data/img/placeholder.png' data-src='data/img/SLUG.jpg' alt='NAME'>
Those images will be loaded via JavaScript after the site finishes building the HTML structure. The placeholder image is scaled the same way the original images are, so it will take up the same space and not cause the layout to repaint as the images load.

      <!-- Render-blocking resources
      Bundling is a problem, because the browser has to load the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before it can paint their rendered results onto the screen. During the few seconds between initial website access and completion of loading, the user sees a blank page, which is a bad experience.
      
      To fix that we can, for example, add defer to JavaScript files: 
-->
      <script src="app.js" defer></script>
    </section>
  </body>
</html>
