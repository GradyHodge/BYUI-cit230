          The message this site seeks to exude is one of authority, trust, style, modern, and slim.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this reason the first of the font pairing will be a serif font, slim, modern, easy to read, not thick or dense.
        </p>
        <h2>Font Pairing: Lora & Nunito </h2>
        <h2>Font: Lora</h2>
        <h3>Lora was chosen as the primary font to deliver a feeling of authority while remaining light and slim.</h3>
        <p>According to Google Fonts, the font Lora, designed by Cyreal, "is a well-balanced contemporary serif with roots in calligraphy. It is a text typeface with moderate contrast well suited for body text.

          A paragraph set in Lora will make a memorable appearance because of its brushed curves in contrast with driving serifs. The overall typographic voice of Lora perfectly conveys the mood of a modern-day story, or an art essay.
          
          Technically Lora is optimised for screen appearance, and works equally well in print.</p>

        <h2>Font Nunito</h2>
        <h3>Nunito was selected as the body font in the pairing because it is similar to the Lora font with its slim and light features but without the flares and flags seen on a serif font such as Lora.</h3>
        <p>According to Google Fonts, the font Lora, designed by Vernon Adams, "Nunito is a well balanced sans serif typeface superfamily, with 2 versions: The project began with Nunito, created by Vernon Adams as a rounded terminal sans serif for display typography. Jacques Le Bailly extended it to a full set of weights, and an accompanying regular non-rounded terminal version, Nunito Sans.</p>

        <h2>Why These fonts make a great pair</h2>
        <p>These two fonts compliment one another as a pair and bolster the brand message of authoritative, sleek, and modern. Their type set features are similar to one another well enough that one feels as an extension of the other.  The transition of flamboyant serif shapes to a more streamlined body font feels natural. Both fonts feel like brother and sister from the same creator.</p>
        <h2>Logo Design Considerations</h2>
        <h3>The logo considerations are to deliver a recognizable message of modern, sleek authority.</h3>
        <p>According to authors from the popular Canva design tool, we will organize the rungear content elements as follows: 
          
          <ol>
            <li>
              <span class="oomph">"Level One:</span> "Level One: Level-one typography will be the most important content or information; 
              these are the most immediately visible typographic element in our design.
            </li>
            <p>Examples: Heading Tag 1, Title box, call to action, and accent elements</p>
            <p>Font-Family: Lora, bold is used on these elements</p>
            <li>
              <span class="oomph">"Level Two:</span> Level-two elements usually help organize your design into sections or group related information together. 
              They shouldn’t stand out as much as your level-one type, but should clearly direct viewers to the different parts 
              of the design and help them navigate it easily.
            </li>
            <p>Examples: Heading Tags 2-3, header, nav bar, any other hierarchical organizer element</p>
            <p>Font-Family: Nunito, bold/regular is used on these elements</p>
            <li>
              <span class="oomph">"Level Three:</span> Organizing the text layout, the level-three typography is the meat of the design. 
              This is where the copywriting lives, where you get into the message of your design. 
              As an example, the design of this product page is simple, but still has at least three levels of typographic hierarchy."(https://www.canva.com/learn/typeface-fonts/)
            </li>
            <p>Examples: Heading Tag 4, paragraph text, footer</p>
            <p>Font-Family: Nunito, regular is used on these elements</p>
